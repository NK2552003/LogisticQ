# LogisticQ Database Setup - Complete

## Overview
Successfully created a comprehensive database structure for the LogisticQ logistics platform with **15 tables** and **67 indexes** optimized for performance.

## Database Tables Created

### Core User Management
- **`users`** (12 columns) - Core user authentication and basic information
- **`business_profiles`** (11 columns) - Extended information for business users  
- **`transporter_profiles`** (15 columns) - Extended information for transporters/drivers
- **`customer_profiles`** (6 columns) - Extended information for customers
- **`admin_profiles`** (6 columns) - Extended information for admin users

### Logistics Operations
- **`shipments`** (37 columns) - Core shipment/order data with comprehensive tracking
- **`tracking_events`** (11 columns) - Real-time shipment tracking history
- **`service_areas`** (9 columns) - Transporter service coverage areas
- **`pricing_rules`** (13 columns) - Dynamic pricing configuration

### Communication & Reviews
- **`chat_messages`** (10 columns) - In-app messaging between users
- **`ratings_reviews`** (12 columns) - User ratings and review system
- **`notifications`** (15 columns) - Push notifications and alerts

### Financial & Documentation
- **`payments`** (16 columns) - Payment transactions and financial records  
- **`documents`** (15 columns) - File uploads, verification documents, photos

### System Management
- **`audit_logs`** (10 columns) - System activity tracking and security

## Foreign Key Relationships
The database maintains **24 foreign key relationships** ensuring data integrity:

### User Relationships
- All profile tables → `users.id`
- All operational tables reference appropriate user types

### Operational Relationships  
- `shipments` ← `tracking_events`, `chat_messages`, `notifications`, `payments`, `ratings_reviews`
- Cross-references between users for payments, ratings, and messages

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes Created (67 total)
- **Primary keys** on all tables
- **Foreign key indexes** for fast joins
- **Status indexes** for filtering operations
- **Geographic indexes** (GIST) for location-based queries
- **Timestamp indexes** for chronological queries
- **Composite indexes** for complex queries

### Key Performance Features
- UUID primary keys for scalability
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Geographic data types (POINT) for location services
- JSONB columns for flexible metadata storage
- Array types for multi-value fields

## Data Types Used

### Core Types
- `UUID` - Primary keys and references
- `VARCHAR` - Text fields with size limits
- `TEXT` - Unlimited text content
- `DECIMAL` - Precise financial calculations
- `INTEGER` - Counting and numeric IDs
- `BOOLEAN` - True/false flags

### Advanced Types
- `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` - Proper timezone handling
- `JSONB` - Flexible structured data
- `TEXT[]` - Array storage
- `POINT` - Geographic coordinates
- `INET` - IP address storage

## Sample Data Testing
✅ Successfully tested:
- User creation and authentication
- Profile management
- Shipment lifecycle
- Tracking events
- Notifications
- All foreign key relationships

## Database Scripts Created

1. **`check-and-create-tables.js`** - Main table creation with shipment operations
2. **`create-profile-tables.js`** - User profile tables creation  
3. **`create-additional-tables.js`** - Supporting tables (documents, pricing, audit)
4. **`verify-database.js`** - Comprehensive testing and verification

## Connection Details
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17.5 on Neon
- **Environment**: Configured via `.env` file
- **Connection**: Uses `@neondatabase/serverless` driver

## Next Steps

### For Development
1. ✅ Database structure complete
2. Update API endpoints to use new tables
3. Implement proper data validation
4. Add database migrations for future changes

### For Production
1. Set up database backups
2. Monitor performance with query analysis
3. Implement connection pooling
4. Set up database monitoring

## Usage Examples

### Creating a User
```javascript
const user = await sql`
  INSERT INTO users (email, password, first_name, last_name, clerk_user_id, role)
  VALUES (${email}, ${hashedPassword}, ${firstName}, ${lastName}, ${clerkId}, ${role})
  RETURNING *;
`;
```

### Creating a Shipment
```javascript
const shipment = await sql`
  INSERT INTO shipments (
    order_number, business_id, customer_id,
    pickup_address, delivery_address,
    package_description, status
  ) VALUES (
    ${orderNumber}, ${businessId}, ${customerId},
    ${pickupAddress}, ${deliveryAddress},
    ${description}, 'pending'
  ) RETURNING *;
`;
```

### Tracking Events
```javascript
const event = await sql`
  INSERT INTO tracking_events (shipment_id, event_type, status, description, location)
  VALUES (${shipmentId}, ${eventType}, ${status}, ${description}, ${location});
`;
```
