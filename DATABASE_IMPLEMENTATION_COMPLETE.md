### 🚀 **Performance and Scalability**
- ✅ **72 indexes created** for optimal query performance
- ✅ Geographic indexes for location-based queries
- ✅ Composite indexes for common API query patterns
- ✅ Foreign key indexes for join operations

### 🔧 **Database Features**
- ✅ **UUID primary keys** for distributed system compatibility
- ✅ **Automatic timestamp triggers** for updated_at fields
- ✅ **Data validation constraints** with CHECK clauses
- ✅ **Comprehensive foreign key relationships**
- ✅ **System settings** initialized with default values

## How to Use

### **For New Installations**
```bash
# The database is already set up and ready!
# Just run your app - all APIs will work correctly
npm start
```

### **For Existing Installations** 
```bash
# Database has been reset and recreated
# All old data has been cleared
# Schema is now fully API-compatible
npm start
```

### **To Verify Everything is Working**
```bash
# Run the verification script
node scripts/verify-schema.js

# Test all API endpoints
node test-all-apis.js
```
